		<h2>EdTech and Analytics in Design Education</h2>
		<p>One of the challenges of teaching graphic design courses is that the instructors must teach both soft design skills and hard design or technical skills. Soft design skills like—aesthetics, intuition, balance, recognizing harmony in page design, and stirring emotions through design—are ephemeral parts of design. These skills are best taught face-to-face in a classroom setting where students can interact, observe, create, and analyze. Hard design skills or technical skills are best learned by observing and then creating the same, or simultaneously observing and creating. ELearning lends itself well to teaching technical skills in a way that facilitates simultaneous observation and creation. Employers want to hire designers who equally possess soft and hard design skills. Given the limited amount of contact hours during the semester, it is difficult to spend time teaching all of the above in a balanced way.</p>

<p>I have developed several innovative ELearning components including interactive simulations and social media components to teach technical design skills in an effective and engaging manner. These have been employed in my courses and have yielded great results to achieve equilibrium in teaching hard and soft design skills.</p>

<p>I was awarded the Learning and Technology Development Council Grant in to further my research work in the area. I have made professional presentations at several peer-reviewed conferences focusing on both art and design education and ELearning. These include prestigious international and national conferences like UCDA Design Education Summit and Sloan Consortium Blended Learning Conference and Workshop. All the presentations were well attended and well received. Many of the attendees expressed that I should create an online bank of these innovative ELearning components and they will be willing to pay subscription to use them in their classrooms or organizations. Feedback and interactions from conferences has been used to enhance the research work and subsequently applied to my courses. Hence my research and teaching have been augmenting each other.</p>

<p>The International Journal of Arts in Society published my research paper titled “A Balanced Way to Teaching Art and Design Using ELearning” in 2013. Most of the conferences have also published my papers in the conference proceedings.</p>

<p>Since 2015, focus of the research has been on creating visual analytics for ELearning and Course Management Systems. Presently most of these tools present information in text or list format. I am creating aesthetic and visual representation of information through explorative and creative designs in the context of 21st Century Skills movement. I presented my initial ideas on these in the presentation titled “Games and Simulation for Engaging and Effective ELearning” at the Heartland ELearning Conference—a premier national conference in the field of ELearning. I have submitted proposals and am awaiting response to present at Educause, OLC Innovate, and UCDA Design Education Summit in 2017.</p>
